# Prop Drilling

This project is using prop drilling to handle the data that the components will render. Make the required updates to fix the project.

## Before you start

After a change SAVE the file, if you don't see any changes, you can hit the reload button in the sandbox browser

## Code time

Check the following files and add the missing props:

- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/components/TodoList.jsx`
- `src/pages/Home.jsx`

## Hints

- Check the file where the component was defined to know what props it needs to work
- Keep an eye in the variables that are unused

## How to know when the app is working?

- A list of the topics of the React Bootcamp should be displayed
- The button on the top right should add a new item to the list
- When hovering over an item the Delete button should work
